*********PATH_FINDER**********

This project aims at depicting the path-finding and navigation systems used in Google Maps, Ola, Uber, etc.  

Firstly, we worked on the algorithm, which is the heart of this project.
For this we implemented A* algorithm - modification of the famous Dijkstra Algorithm.

Secondly, we worked on the GUI.
It was very minimal at first, just some colored blocks in the starting.
Now we have improved the image quality and made it look more attractive.

At last but not the least, we integrated the algorithm and GUI subsystems into one MAIN.rkt file.
Feel free to try it out (:D)
